Gophie stream allows streaming videos using browser player. You can pass a query argument to the stream call to search for a specific query or left blank to retrieve latest uploaded movies on the specified engine. Full list of supported players can be found at https://github.com/bisoncorps/mplayer.  
example:
  gophie stream Jumanji --player vlc (stream Jumanji using VLC Media Player)
  gophie stream -e fzmovies (check for latest movies on fzmovies for streaming)
